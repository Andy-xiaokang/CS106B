<h1 class="title">Guide to Partners</h1>

<hr>

<p class="attribution">

</p>



<div id="content"><p>Starting with Assignment 3, you will be allowed to work on the CS106B programming assignments in pairs. Working on coding problems in pairs is a skill in and of itself, and this guide is designed to help you make the best use of this opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-i-partner-with">Who Can I Partner With?</h2>

<p>Once we reach Assignment 3, you will be allowed to work on the assignments jointly with a partner. Your partner must be</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone who is currently a student in CS106B, and</li>
  <li>who is in the same discussion section as you.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to work with someone as a partner and they aren't in your discussion section, talk to your section leader and see if you can arrange to swap into their section (or have them swap into yours).</p>

<h2 id="should-i-work-with-a-partner">Should I Work With a Partner?</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre often asked whether it‚Äôs a good idea to work with a partner in CS106B. The answer is ‚Äúit depends, but in general it‚Äôs a good idea to have a assignment partner.‚Äù</p>

<p>There are many advantages to having a partner on the assignments. Here‚Äôs an unsorted list of why it can be helpful to work in a pair:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your problem set partner can serve as a sounding board for ideas as you‚Äôre working through trickier parts of the assignment.</li>
  <li>Having a partner keeps you accountable to make slow and steady progress on the assignment over the week, giving you more time to digest content and ask for help if you need it.</li>
  <li>As you're coding together, your and your partner can read over each other's work and ask questions you each individually might not have thought to ask.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs a great way to meet other folks in the class and make lasting friends!</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, some people feel most comfortable working on their own. If you‚Äôre in that camp, that‚Äôs totally fine! You certainly don‚Äôt need to have a partner in CS106B, and it‚Äôs completely reasonable to work through all the assignments on your own. Lots of students do just that and have a good experience with the course.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-switch-partners">Can I Switch Partners?</h2>

<p>Yes, absolutely! You are not required to work with the same partner all the time. Our only rule is that if you‚Äôve started working on an assignment with someone, you need to submit that specific assignment jointly. After the due date, you‚Äôre free to switch who you‚Äôre working with for the next assignment (or to do the assignment solo if you‚Äôd like). This happens all the time, either because someone‚Äôs partner decides to take CS106B in another quarter, or because the partnership wasn‚Äôt a good match, or because three friends are rotating partnering with each other on the weekly assignments.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-i-work-with-my-partner">How Should I Work With My Partner?</h2>
<p>Thank you for asking this question ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to be strategic with how you complete assignments in a pair. In fact, historically we‚Äôve found that folks who work well with their partners tend to do markedly better than students who don‚Äôt work effectively with the people they‚Äôre partnered with.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs begin with the Big List of Bad Ideas. When working with a partner, make sure not to do the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Do not</em></strong> have one person do all the work and the other person just attach their name at the end. This is borderline dishonest (if you‚Äôre submitting as a pair, we expect that both you and your partner actually did the work) and is one of the most common ways we see people have high assignment scores and then flame out on exams. Remember ‚Äì your ultimate goal is to master the material and techniques we‚Äôre teaching, not simply to get through the week‚Äôs assignment.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Do not</em></strong> have one person do half the assignment and the other person do the other half. You and your partner are not likely to end up being good cooks if one of you just practices saut√©ing and the other just practices roasting. You and your partner are not likely to end up being good woodworkers if one of you just practices using a table saw an the other just practices using a miter saw. You and your partner are not likely to end up being good musicians if one of you just practices playing pieces in major scales and the other another just practices playing pieces in minor scales. Each part of the assignments is calibrated to hit some particular nuance of the material, and if you don‚Äôt work through all of them you‚Äôll miss some important skills and concepts.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Do not</em></strong> take turns completing assignments. The material in CS106B builds on itself, and if you take a week off from practicing coding you can easily get yourself into a point where you can‚Äôt get caught back up.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that out of the way, what should you do? There are many different ways to partner with someone effectively, and we don‚Äôt want to give a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach. For each problem on the problem sets, we recommend picking one of the following approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Complete the assignments separately, then compare and synthesize</em></strong>. In this approach, the two people working as partners each do their best to complete the assignment individually. Once they‚Äôre done or mostly done, they come together and read over each other‚Äôs code, giving feedback about what they liked (‚Äúoh, I didn‚Äôt think of that ‚Äì that‚Äôs so clever!‚Äù) and what they think needs work (‚ÄúI see what you‚Äôre going for here, but I think X works in way Y rather than way Z‚Äù). Finally, the two partners write a single final submission jointly, synthesizing ideas from each solution. This gives both partners significant practice critiquing code (a hugely valuable skill!) and lets each person benefit from the other‚Äôs insights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Work each problem together, trading off who leads.</em></strong> In this approach, both partners work together on the assignment simultaneously, bouncing ideas off one another and offering real-time feedback and critiques of ideas. To make sure that both partners get experience with problem-solving, on each problem one person will take a lead role, choosing which paths to explore, drawing pictures, etc. The other person will take a supporting role, offering feedback about ideas the lead person generates (‚Äúyeah, that sounds good!,‚Äù ‚ÄúI remember concept X working differently ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt it mean Y and Z?,‚Äù ‚ÄúI think you meant X when you said Y there.,‚Äù etc.) The partners trade off the lead role to ensure that both of them learn both to synthesize new ideas and to evaluate potential routes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Do some preliminary exploration, then come together to solve things</em></strong>. This is a hybrid of the two above approaches. Each partner spends some time individually looking over the assignment and trying out some ideas. This could include things like sketching out pseudocode, drawing pictures (‚Äúhere‚Äôs my visualization of what this problem is asking us‚Äù), and reviewing relevant lecture topics (‚ÄúI think this is asking something along the same lines as this lecture example‚Äù). From there, the partners can either decide to try to solve the problem individually using what they‚Äôve found or work on the problem jointly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond these strategies, though, there‚Äôs a number of points of General Good Citizenship that you should keep in mind when working in a pair. All of these, by the way, will transfer to the workplace and to other personal relationships. üòÉ</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Agree on your method of communication</em></strong>. Will you be communicating over text, over email, or some other means? And what‚Äôs a reasonable turnaround time? Different people feel differently about this. Some people like using email to communicate and are fine with 24-hour delays in responding. Other folks like texting and want immediate responses. What matters less is how you choose to stay in touch with one another than that you agree on what the parameters are. Talking about this up front will make things a lot easier.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Communicate expectations</em></strong>. We listed three reasonable approaches to the assignments above. Make sure you don‚Äôt spend the week solving everything individually preparing for a joint meeting while your partner is expecting to work the problems together with you each day.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Be civil</em></strong>. Don‚Äôt tell your partner they‚Äôre stupid because they made a small error. Don‚Äôt ask how your partner could not have known something if they don‚Äôt know it. That‚Äôs just basic decency.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-submit-work-with-a-partner">How Do I Submit Work With a Partner?</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre working with a partner, <strong><em>you must make a single joint submission</em></strong>. The good news is that Paperless makes this easy ‚Äì one partner uploads the joint submission, then adds the other person as a partner. If you forgot to add your partner‚Äôs name when making the submission (please try to avoid this, though it‚Äôs less uncommon than you‚Äôd think), ping your section leader to let them know.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-we-cant-agree-on-something">What Happens If We Can‚Äôt Agree on Something?</h2>
<p>It sometimes happens that you and your partner won‚Äôt be able to agree on something. If this is something of a technical nature (one person says ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre supposed to do this in way <em>X</em>‚Äù and the other says ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre supposed to do this in way <em>Y</em>‚Äù), you can always ask on EdStem or stop by office hours. Disputes based on a factual question are often easy to resolve, and you‚Äôll both learn something from the process. Often times, we find that when there‚Äôs a genuine factual disagreement, it‚Äôs on a nuanced point and we‚Äôre very glad people asked!</p>

<p>In other cases, these disagreements can be a bit harder to resolve. For example, imagine that your partner shows up to a meeting completely unprepared, or that your partner has simply stopped responding to texts or emails, or that your partner just plain isn‚Äôt nice to you. It‚Äôs not fun when that happens.</p>

<p>So what should you do? This will ultimately be specific to your situation, but you have some options. One option would be to try to patch things up with your partner. That‚Äôs a great life skill to develop. You can get advice about how best to do this by talking to your dorm staff, to your academic advisor, by taking a class in negotiation or interpersonal dynamics (we have them here, and they‚Äôre great!), or by doing some searching online.</p>

<p>Another option would be to make it to the end of the week‚Äôs assignment through whatever compromises are necessary and then stop working with the person. Sometimes you and the other person just don‚Äôt work well together, and it‚Äôs good to move on. If so, we‚Äôre sorry the experience didn‚Äôt go well, but hopefully it serves as a good learning experience for future partnerships. If you do this, though, don't ghost the other person. Make sure to (civilly!) tell your partner that you won't be working with them so that they can plan accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="partners-and-retaking-cs106b">Partners and Retaking CS106B</h2>

<p>If you are retaking CS106B, or if your partner is retaking the class, make sure that you and your partner comply with the <a href="honor_code.html" title="CS106B and the Honor Code">appropriate Honor Code policies</a> regarding past work and reusing work.</p>
