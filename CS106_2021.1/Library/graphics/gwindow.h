/**
 * This class represents a graphics window that supports simple graphics.
 * A GWindow is a first-class citizen in our GUI subsystem; all graphical
 * programs will create at least one GWindow to hold other interactors and
 * graphical objects for display on the screen.
 *
 * A GWindow simultaneously serves two major graphical purposes:
 *
 * 1) A top-level container for interactors.
 * You can call the addToRegion and add methods to add interactors to the north,
 * south, west, east, and center regions of the window.
 * The center region holds at most one interactor that expands in both dimensions
 * to fill pixels not occupied by the other four regions.
 * This is analogous to Java AWT/Swing's BorderLayout system.
 * The window uses an internal GContainer that we call its "content pane" to
 * layout the positions and sizes of these interactors.
 * See gcontainer.h for more detail about layout and containers.
 *
 * 2) A graphical canvas for drawing shapes, lines, and colors.
 * A GWindow contains a central graphical canvas that is implemented as an
 * object of type GCanvas.  The canvas will appear on the window the moment you
 * call any drawing method on the window.
 *
 * The graphical canvas consists of two layers.
 * The background layer provides a surface for drawing static pictures that
 * involve no animation, or for 2D pixel-based drawing algorithms.
 * See gcanvas.h and gobjects.h for more detail about drawing shapes, objects,
 * and pixels.
 *
 * The GWindow class includes several drawXxx and fillXxx methods that draw
 * lines, rectangles, and ovals on the background layer without the client
 * needing to directly create objects from the gobjects.h hierarchy.
 *
 * The foreground layer provides an abstraction for adding stateful shapes and
 * graphical objects onto the canvas.  The add() methods that accept GObject
 * parameters place these objects onto the foreground layer.  The advantage of
 * the foreground layer is that you can manipulate the object over time, such as
 * moving it, changing its color, size, or other properties, and see these
 * changes immediately on the screen.  This makes the foreground layer most
 * appropriate for animations or moving sprites.
 *
 * You can use the two GWindow paradigms together in the same window.
 * For example, you can place a row of buttons in the north or south while
 * drawing shapes onto the canvas in the center of the window.
 *
 * If you add() a GInteractor to the center region of the window, we will assume
 * that you do not want the graphical canvas and will replace it with the added
 * interactor.
