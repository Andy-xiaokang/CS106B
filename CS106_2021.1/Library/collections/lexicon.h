/**
 * This class is used to represent a <b><i>lexicon,</i></b> or word list.
 * The main difference between a lexicon and a dictionary is that
 * a lexicon does not provide any mechanism for storing definitions;
 * the lexicon contains only words, with no associated information.
 * It is therefore similar to a set of strings, but with a more
 * space-efficient internal representation.  The <code>Lexicon</code>
 * class supports efficient lookup operations for words and prefixes.
 *
 * <p>As an example of the use of the <code>Lexicon</code> class, the
 * following program lists all the two-letter words in the lexicon
 * stored in <code>EnglishWords.dat</code>:
 *
 *<pre>
 *    int main() {
 *       Lexicon english("EnglishWords.dat");
 *       for (string word : english) {
 *          if (word.length() == 2) {
 *             cout << word << endl;
 *          }
 *       }
 *       return 0;
 *    }
 *</pre>
