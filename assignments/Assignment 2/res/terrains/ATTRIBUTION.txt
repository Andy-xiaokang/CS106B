The raw data for all maps, unless noted otherwise, comes from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's website:

    https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/wcs-client/
    
We heard about this data source after reading Baker Franke's "Mountain Paths" Nifty assignment, available here:

    http://nifty.stanford.edu/2016/franke-mountain-paths/
    
The files Iceland.terrain, RioDeJaneiro.terrain, PearlRiverDelta.terrain, TeIkaAMaui.terrain,
VelingalaSenegal.terrain, and GulfOfGuinea.terrain were derived from the GEBCO 2020 Gridded Bathymetry Survey:

Some of the data were smoothed using a two-step grid refinement algorithm followed by a Gaussian blur.
    
The MarsOlmpusMons.terrain and MarsCraters.terrain files were created by former Winter 2020 CS106B student Varun
Shenoy based on the data available online at ASU (http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/mola_color/).
