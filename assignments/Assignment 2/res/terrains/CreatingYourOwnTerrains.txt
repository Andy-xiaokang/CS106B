Here's how to create your own terrain file!

1. In a plain-text editor, make a new file. You'll want to save it to this directory.

2. The first line of your file should be the string "local", without quotes, all in lower case.

3. The next two lines of the file should be the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

4. The next line indicates how many water sources there are in the world.

5. For each of those water sources, add in two more lines giving the row and column index of where that water source is.

6. After that, write out the Grid<double> representing the water heights by writing out the data one row at a time, with spaces between the heights.

Hope this helps! Looking forward to seeing what you came up with!
