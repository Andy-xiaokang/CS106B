                         Corpus Information Sheet

This corpus is collected from the Nunavut Hansard between 1999 and 2017,
representing 16 sessions over 4 assemblies, and 687 days of debates in the
Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.

Characterization of the data and potential biases:
 - The Nunavut Hansard consists of legislative assembly debates, and as such it
   very different from normal speech or written language.
 - As described in more details in the paper, in the early years the
   transcription process was done in English first: the English speeches and
   the live English interpretation of Inuktitut speeches constituted the
   English version. The Inuktitut version was then a translation of the English
   version. Starting around 2005-2006, the Hansard was produced in both
   languages by transcribing the original speeches or their live interpretation
   directly.

File format
 - All text files are in utf-8
 - Inuktitut text is in syllabics, unlike previous versions of the Nunavut
   Hansard corpus. If needed, conversion to ICI transliteration can be done
   using the uniconv tool included with the open-source editor yudit:
      uniconv -decode utf-8 -encode Inuktitut-ICI < syllabics-in.txt > ICI-out.txt
   Caveat: that command outputs iso-8859-1 text, which needs to be converted
   back to utf-8 for further processing:
      uniconv -decode iso-8859-1 -encode utf-8 < ICI-out.txt > ICI-utf8.txt
   Caveat 2: uniconv leaves input characters it does not know how to handle in
   this escape sequence format: \u2219, which should be replaced back by their
   utf-8 characters. The provided script scripts/normalize-apos-romanized.pl
   can help post-process these as well as applying other character
   standardization rules.
 - NunavutHansard.en, NunavutHansard.iu and NunavutHansard.id are line aligned
   files with the nth line in each file forming the nth sentence pair with its
   provenance information. See below for more details.

Data processing
 - Extraction of the sentences from the Word documents:
    - Assembly 1, Sessions 1-5, Inuktitut: these Word documents use the
      Prosyl/Tunngavik font to encode syllabic characters. Paragraphs were
      extracted and converted to utf8 in a font-aware way using the IUTools
      toolkit from Inuktitut Computing (Benoît Farley).
    - All other files: the rest of the Word documents use normal UTF8.
      Paragraphs were extracted using AlignFactory by Terminotix.

 - Some manual clean-up was done to remove parts of the files that were not
   actually parallel. Such parts were mostly in the appendices, which were not
   always present in both languages.

 - The rest of the pipeline was processed using tools from the Portage machine
   translation toolkit developed at the NRC: sentence splitting, tokenization,
   sentence alignment, etc.

 - Sentence alignment was done in a multi-step process similar to Bob Moore's
   aligner (Robert C. Moore, Association-based bilingual word alignment, 2005)
   using ssal, the NRC's reimplementation of that algorithm:
    - Align paragraphs à la Gale&Church, then align sentences within
      paragraphs, again à la Gale&Church.
    - Build an IBM model using the resulting corpus, applying tokenization and
      lowercasing. In the JSALT pre-release, no segmentation of the words
      themselves was used. In this release BPE 10K was used. See the paper for
      full details of this segmentation and others we experimented with.
    - Re-align paragraphs using the IBM model à la Moore, then align sentences
      within paragraphs, again using the IBM model.

 - The final output is the original text (not tokenized or segmented), in
   parallel plain text files, containing typically one sentence per line.
    - Original paragraph boundaries that were not collapsed in paragraph
      alignment are preserved as lines that are blank on both sides, but can be
      trivially filtered out for applications that need only sentence pairs.
    - 0-1 and 1-0 alignments were preserved and should also be filtered for
      sentence-pair oriented processing.
    - The Hansard.id file contains the normalized filename and line number each
      sentence pair came from, e.g., Hansard_19990401 65 is the 65th line,
      after alignment, from the 1999-04-01 debates.
    - No filtering was performed post alignment: taking either side of the
      corpus for a given day of debate, one has the entire transcript from that
      day, in the same order as in the original Word file, with paragraph
      boundaries that were not collapsed represented by typically 2, sometimes
      1, blank lines.

Original documents in plain text
 - We include a copy of the corpus as extracted from the Word documents and
   cleaned up, in plain text, with one paragraph per line. The intent of this
   version is to enable research on improving sentence alignment.

Standard split into train, dev, devtest and test
 - In order to facilitate standardized MT evaluations, NH 3.0 provides a
   standard split of the corpus, with a target of having a dev, devtest and
   test set each with more or less 3000 unique sentence pairs.

   To enable capturing topic drift and whole document phenomena, these sets are
   the last files in the corpus, chronologically, rather than being sampled
   randomly. With each corpus file corresponding to one day of debate, the last
   three days constitute the test set: 2017-06-06, 07, 08; the three previous
   ones, the devtest set: 2017-06-01, 02, 05; and the three before that, the
   dev set: 2017-03-14, 05-30, 05-31. Everything else is train: 678 debate days
   from 1999-04-01 to 2017-03-13.

   Two versions of the dev, devtest and test files are provided: the first
   version has whole documents, with blank lines marking paragraphs as
   described above, while the -dedup versions were processed as follows to
   facilitate sentence-oriented MT evaluation:
    - For each of the last nine corpus days/files, remove sentence pairs where
      either side is empty, and remove sentence pairs that exist identically
      (using whole string equality) in any earlier day in the corpus.
      As a result, a sentence pair in train cannot exist in any deduped held
      out set, but also, a sentence pair in dev is not in devtest-dedup or
      test-dedup, and a sentence pair in devtest is not in test-dedup.

 - File sizes, according to wc (lines, words, characters, bytes - note that
   lines are not sentences since paragraphs are marked by one or two blank
   lines):

Clean-up scripts
 - We include sample scripts that we have used in our machine translation
   experiments to clean-up the data. These perform transliteration and several
   automated clean-up steps for various issues we observed in the data. These
   scripts are in no way a definitive recommendation on how to process or
   transliterate the data, we simply provide them to help other researchers
   benefit from the work we've already put into pre-processing this data for
   MT.

 - No attempt at spelling standardization was performed on the corpus. You will
   find character combinations that are non-standard, syllabic characters from
   other Canadian Indigenous languages that are not part of the Inuktitut
   alphabet, spelling variations, conversion errors, etc. The corpus is
   published as the text is found in the official Hansard. However, we provide
   a script for basic spelling normalization that you may use:
   scripts/normalize-iu-spelling.pl. This script systematically applies the
   rules of spelling from Inuktut Tusaalanga (https://tusaalanga.ca/node/2506)
   that are reliable and unambiguous. See scripts/normalize-iu-spelling.readme
   for a lot more details on the topic.

Gold standard
 - We include our gold standard annotations in the XML format used by InterText
   Editor (https://wanthalf.saga.cz/intertext).
 - The annotations in annotator1/ and annotator2/ were independently hand
   aligned by two bilingual native speakers of Inuktitut using InterText
   Editor.
 - The annotations in annotator1-consensus and annotator2-consensus are the
   result of consensus surveys completed by the annotators on all differences
   between their alignments.
   Whenever they agreed to that only one or the other alignment block in their
   first pass annotations was correct, the consensus annotation reflects that
   alignment, but cases where they thought both options were OK or in need of
   fixing, their original annotations were left as is. Most cases left as is
   are due to incomplete translations making the alignment task ill defined.

Acknowledgements
 - The NRC would like to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of Riel Gallant
   and John Quirke of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut for providing the
   original Word files for this corpus.
 - We would like to acknowledge the work of Gavin Nesbitt, Amanda Kuluguqtuq,
