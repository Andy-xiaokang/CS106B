The code for maximum weighted matching was formed by shamelessly copying a C
implementation by Ed Rothberg in 1985, updating it to make it legal C++ code,
removing everything that wasn't needed for the maximum matching logic, and
cleaning up the interface a bit. The original source can be found here:

Most of the code here is taken directly from the original.
