Put your answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1: finish = 'C'  numDisks = 5  start = 'A'  temp = 'B'



Q2: TowersOfHanoi.cpp solveTowersOfHanoi(int, char, char, char)



Q3: 31



Q4: 15



Q5: "12"



Q6: Set<string> thisOption = permutationsRec(remaining, chosen += ch);  change chosen += ch to chosen + ch



Q7: when if calls permutationsRec(remaining, chosen += ch) function, it changes the chosen argument first, that means whenever you
    call the recursive(callee) function you changed the caller's choosen argument,
    permutationsRec("12", choosen = "")
        permutationsRec("2", "1")  this function implicitly changed the caller's choosen to "1"
            permutationsRec("", "12") this function implicily changed the caller's choosen to "12"

    cause the output to {"12", "1"+"21"} the choosen = "" changed to "1" is implicitly when the first call
